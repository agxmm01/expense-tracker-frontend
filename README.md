# Expense & Financial Forecasting Dashboard (Frontend)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the **frontend implementation** of the *Expense and Financial Forecasting System*, developed using **React**, **Vite**, and **Bootstrap**.  
The frontend is responsible for presenting expense data, revenue trends, burn rate, and forecasting outputs generated by backend services and ML models.

The application focuses on **data visualization, user interaction, and modular UI design**, serving as an interface for financial analytics and research experimentation.

## 🧪 Research Context
This frontend is part of a **Major Project (B.E. CSE – AI & ML specialization)** at Chandigarh University.  
It supports experimentation and visualization for financial forecasting research.

> **Note:** The frontend is not the primary research contribution.  
> The research focus lies in **forecasting models, evaluation metrics, and comparative analysis**.
